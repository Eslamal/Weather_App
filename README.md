## Description
This is a weather app built using Jetpack Compose, Dagger Hilt, Retrofit, and Kotlin. It fetches weather data from an external API, displays the information on the screen, and uses modern Android architecture components to manage app state.

## Key Technologies:
- Hilt: For dependency injection and managing dependencies throughout the app.
- Jetpack Compose: For building a modern, declarative UI.
- Retrofit: For making API calls and converting the response into Kotlin objects.
- Kotlin: The primary programming language used for the development of the app.
- Location Services: For getting the userâ€™s current location to fetch weather information.
- ViewModel: For managing UI-related data lifecycle-consciously.
## Features:
- Displays weather information for the current location.
- Fetches weather data from an external API using Retrofit.
- Uses Hilt for Dependency Injection.
- Implements a clean and modern UI using Jetpack Compose.
- Provides location-based weather updates with Location Services.
- Architecture follows modern practices for Android apps (MVVM pattern with ViewModel and LiveData).
